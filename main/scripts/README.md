## [IP_stream.py](https://github.com/Lucky-0ne/receipt_scanner/blob/main/main/scripts/IP_stream.py)
Main script that uses OpenCV to live stream video from an IP camera, allows user interaction through trackbars for dynamic regions of interest, detects specific colors ('c') within a defined bounding box and offers functionality to zoom ('z') into these detections, with the ability to save ('s') snapshots of detected ROIs. End the stream with 'q'.

## [classify_images.iypnb](https://github.com/Lucky-0ne/receipt_scanner/blob/main/main/scripts/classify_images.ipynb)
- loads the stored image snippets generated by [IP_stream.py](https://github.com/Lucky-0ne/receipt_scanner/blob/main/main/scripts/IP_stream.py)
- processes them to reduce API calls
- calls Google Vision AI API to predict the image snippets content
- stores the labeled image snippets for validation
- loads the labels for calculating the results

## [utils.py](https://github.com/Lucky-0ne/receipt_scanner/blob/main/main/scripts/utils.py)
Provides basic utility functions (scalable plots in .ipynb files & predefined color bounds)

## [idea_extension.py](https://github.com/Lucky-0ne/receipt_scanner/blob/main/main/scripts/idea_extension.py)
Provides the same functionality as the main script (IP_stream.py), but focuses on also tracking/extracting the purchased items from the cash receipts.
